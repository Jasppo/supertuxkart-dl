# Deep Learning Project - Super TuxKart Ice Hockey Image Agent

Super TuxKart is a an open-source kart racing game which features a 2 vs 2 ice hockey mode. The goal of this game is for the karts to push a puck through the enemy goal. Through this project an imagebased agent was designed to detect the puck’s location from in-game images, and a controller was fine-tuned to act based on the agent’s detections.
